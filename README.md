# File Archiver
File Archiver is a simple program under NodeJS and Electron that helps you archive files and stick tags on them.
You can search by tags or name around files that you added to archive.

## Please help me improve this program
I would be very happy if I see that any body else develop this program and if you can't please tell me your opinion about the File Archiver that so I can improve this.
